# Monte Carlo Integral Calculator

This is a multi-page application made with React, vanilla javascript, and CSS that estimates the value of definite integrals with a Monte Carlo simulation. The methodology explained more in depth on the website.

This project was made after I became interested in the applications of stochastic methods to theoretical scenarios, like definite integral estimation, resulting in the creation of this application.

## How to Use
To use the actual calculator, first navigate to the Calculator tab. Then, choose of the 3 functions whose integral you want to estimate. Then, input the lower and upper bounds of the definite integral, and then press Submit. You will then see the estimated value of the definite integral as a result of the Monte Carlo simulation.

##Future extensions 
One future extension I am looking into with this project is the ability for users to enter their own functions to integrate. Another future extension is utilizing some form of typesetting for the math equations, to make them look more aesthetically pleasing.
